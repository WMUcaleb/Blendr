## Overview
### Description
Blendr is an app that allows a user to view a feed of nearby restaurants and favorite them. The favorited restaurants will be sorted in a list. This list can be filtered depending on the type of food the user is hungry for. Users may also see reviews of other users and chat with them and may potentially become a food Tinder app.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Food 
- **Mobile:** The app would be developed for mobile users, but could potentially be used on a computer.
- **Story:**
- **Market:** Any person could choose to use this app, especially those who have a difficult time deciding on where they/their group wants to eat. 
- **Habit:** This can be used as little or as often as somebody would like. 
- **Scope:** First we would start with allowing users to favorite restaurants, then it could evolve to a food-review app that allows reviewers to chat with each other. This app could have potential collaborations with UberEats in the future.
